        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">
                <p>How does AI Spy Phone Pro work?</p>

            </div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>AI Spy Phone Pro uses complex algorithms powered by artificial intelligence to monitor phones in a completely legal way. By providing the email, phone number, and type of phone along with the operating system, a unique algorithm is generated to monitor phone activities and analyze behaviors. It provides real-time, accurate data and allows you to track all activities on the phone through a special link. Once the target person accesses the link, a hidden app installs on their phone, transmitting the data back to you through AI-driven monitoring.</p>
